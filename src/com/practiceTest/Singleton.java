/*
The Singleton's purpose is to control object creation, limiting the number of objects to only
        one. Since there is only one Singleton instance, any instance fields of a Singleton will occur
        only once per class, just like static fields
*/

/*The easiest implementation consists of a private constructor and a field to hold its result,
        and a static accessor method with a name like getInstance().
        The private field can be assigned from within a static initializer block or, more simply,
        using an initializer. The getInstance( ) method (which must be public) then simply returns
        this instance âˆ’*/
